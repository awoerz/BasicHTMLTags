  <h1>Woerz Family Vacation 2020</h1>
  <h3>Adventure Summary</h3>
  <p style="width: 60%;">Yes, in the middle of the seemingly world ending pandemic, we went on vacation to Florida. Compared to what was going on in Indiana with masks mandates, it felt straight up like freedom! In Florida, there was no mask mandate. There were people enjoying life as if there was no pandemic. The beaches were as beautiful as ever with white glistening sand and teal waves crashing against the beach. The air smelled salty, the waves sounded like cymbols making a muffled crash, and the segulls chirped loudly as they looked for tourists to toss them crumbs. We enjoyed a number of things while in Florida and we can't wait to go back again and visit soon.</p>

  <h3>For fun, here is a brief list in no particular order of some of the things we did</h3>
